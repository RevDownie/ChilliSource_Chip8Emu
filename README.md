# Chilli Source: Chip-8 Emulator #

A Chip-8 emulator with Public Domain Roms that runs in the Chilli Source free, open-source, game engine (www.chilli-works.com). Chilli Source is cross platform but due to the keyboard requirement the emulator will be unplayable on Android or iOS.

### Why Chip-8? ###

I plan to write more complex emulators and this seemed a good starting place. Hopefully this repository will be useful as a learning resource for others,

### How do I get set up? ###

* Chilli Source is included as a submodule when pulling.
* Requires JRE 8
* Requires Python 2.7+
* Requires Visual Studio 2013 (express or community will work and are free)


* Repo owner or admin
